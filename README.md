# Wainwrights

This Shiny app displays the progress of ticking off the Wainwrights.

-   **Shiny App:** [https://wainwrights.shinyapps.io/wainwrights/](https://wainwrights.shinyapps.io/wainwrights/)
-   **Google Sheet Data:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asnafeRHRpv9Ddf3HVg6q9Lr0cn3hevj4c2aq2hqcZc/edit?gid=0#gid=0](httpss://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1asnafeRHRpv9Ddf3HVg6q9Lr0cn3hevj4c2aq2hqcZc/edit?gid=0#gid=0)

## How it works

The app reads data from the Google Sheet linked above. To mark a Wainwright as "ticked off", simply add any text to the corresponding cell in the spreadsheet for a person (L, B, or J). The app will then update and display the new completion status as bubbles on the map. The colour of the bubble indicates how many people have ticked off that wainwright (0=Blue, 1 or 2=Yellow, 3=Green).

On the stats tab, expand each row for a list of completed tops.
